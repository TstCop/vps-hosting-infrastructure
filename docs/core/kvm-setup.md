# KVM Setup Instructions

## Introduction
This document provides detailed instructions for setting up KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) on your server. KVM is a virtualization solution for Linux that allows you to run multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical host.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:
- A Linux server with a supported version of the kernel (typically 3.10 or later).
- Sufficient hardware resources (CPU, RAM, and storage) to run your VMs.
- Root or sudo access to the server.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install Required Packages
Update your package manager and install the necessary packages for KVM:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils
```

### 2. Verify Installation
Check if KVM is installed correctly by running:

```bash
sudo kvm-ok
```

You should see a message indicating that KVM is supported.

### 3. Start and Enable the Libvirt Service
Start the Libvirt service and enable it to start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl start libvirtd
sudo systemctl enable libvirtd
```

### 4. Add Your User to the Libvirt Group
To manage VMs without root privileges, add your user to the `libvirt` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG libvirt $(whoami)
```

Log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

### 5. Configure Networking
Set up a bridge network if you want your VMs to have access to the external network. Edit the network configuration file (e.g., `/etc/network/interfaces` or use `netplan` depending on your distribution) to include a bridge configuration.

### 6. Create a Virtual Machine
You can create a VM using the `virt-install` command or through a graphical interface like `virt-manager`. Hereâ€™s an example command to create a VM:

```bash
sudo virt-install \
--name myvm \
--ram 2048 \
--disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/myvm.img,size=10 \
--vcpus 2 \
--os-type linux \
--os-variant ubuntu20.04 \
--network bridge=br0 \
--graphics none \
--cdrom /path/to/ubuntu.iso
```

### 7. Manage Your Virtual Machines
You can manage your VMs using the `virsh` command-line tool or `virt-manager` for a graphical interface. Common commands include:

- List all VMs: `virsh list --all`
- Start a VM: `virsh start myvm`
- Stop a VM: `virsh shutdown myvm`
- Delete a VM: `virsh undefine myvm`

## Conclusion
You have successfully set up KVM on your server. You can now create and manage virtual machines as needed. For further customization and advanced configurations, refer to the official KVM documentation.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, check the following:
- Ensure that your CPU supports virtualization (Intel VT-x or AMD-V).
- Verify that the necessary kernel modules are loaded (`kvm`, `kvm_intel`, or `kvm_amd`).
- Review logs in `/var/log/libvirt/` for any error messages.
